TIFF and PNG
------------

The two formats contain the same image.
The reason is simple: Matlab/Octave had difficulties
reading TIFF, while Luminance HDR could not read png...
So both formats have to be present.

The original DICOM files are not available, only
the TIFF/PNG conversion, as it is stated in the paper.

The ship image is taken by the author, and it can
be used for any purpose without prior permission.
I dedicated the image to public domain.
